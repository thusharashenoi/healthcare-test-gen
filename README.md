# Req2Test.AI â€“ AI-Powered Healthcare Test Case Generator

## Overview

**Req2Test.AI** is an AI-driven solution that automates the generation of test cases for healthcare software from natural-language requirements. It interprets complex healthcare specifications, generates structured JSON test cases, maintains full requirement-to-test traceability, and supports integration with enterprise toolchains like Jira, Polarion, and Azure DevOps. The system also supports GDPR-compliant testing using synthetic datasets.

This project is deployed as a React + Vite application with a user-friendly interface for uploading requirements, generating test cases, reviewing them, and exporting to downstream workflows.
